# Explosive Neutralization Training in Virtual Reality

Welcome to the repository for the **Explosive Neutralization Training in Virtual Reality** project. This advanced VR simulation, developed in Unreal Engine 5, provides a safe, immersive, and interactive environment for learning how to neutralize pipe bombs. This project is the practical component of our research paper, which demonstrated that VR training is significantly more effective than traditional text-based methods.

## üöÄ Key Features of the VR Simulation

This VR simulation is more than just a visual guide; it's a hands-on training tool designed for deep, experiential learning.

* **High Quality Model Assets made in Blender**: 
A 3D model of pipe bombs and related components, all crafted in Blender. This asset is optimized for VR performance and realism, enabling users to closely inspect and interact with each part during training.

* **Interactive Bomb Components**: Every part of the pipe bomb model can be individually grabbed, inspected, and manipulated. This allows trainees to understand the mechanics and assembly of an IED in a way that text cannot replicate.

* **Real-time Feedback & Performance Tracking**: The simulation logs user interactions and tracks performance, including failed neutralization attempts. This data is crucial for identifying knowledge gaps and providing adaptive training.

* **Integrated Learning**: Theoretical concepts are displayed as readable slides within the VR environment, reinforcing learning as the user performs practical tasks.

* **Safe Learning Environment**: Trainees can learn from their mistakes without the catastrophic consequences of a real-world error, which enhances confidence and procedural mastery.

## üïπÔ∏è Simulation Scenes & Levels

The training is structured into a series of scenes, each designed to build upon the last, taking the user from basic concepts to a full neutralization procedure.

### Scene 1: Introduction to IED & EOD Basics
This introductory scene familiarizes the user with the fundamental concepts and terminology of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Users learn to identify basic threats and understand the roles of EOD personnel.

### Scene 2: Pipe Bomb Fundamentals
Here, trainees can analyse the device to learn about its core components, basic construction, and various initiation mechanisms.

### Scene 3: The Defusal Procedure
This is the core of the simulation. Users are guided through the step-by-step process of neutralizing a live pipe bomb. The simulation enforces safety precautions and requires the user to follow the correct sequence for disarming the device, such as detaching the correct wires, disarming the components safely.

## üìä Performance Analytics

A key advantage of this VR system is the ability to track individual performance. The simulation records every attempt a user makes to successfully neutralize the bomb, providing valuable insight into the learning curve of each trainee.
